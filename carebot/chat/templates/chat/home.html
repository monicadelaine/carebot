        <p>Carebot is a chatbot powered by ChatGPT v3.5 that helps connect Alabama residents to healthcare resources. 
            Using a database of healthcare providers, the services they offer, their locations, and the users' zip code, the chatbot can connect the user to a healthcare service provider near them. 
            Given we don't have any location data from the user, the chatbot will prompt the user to input their zip code, or in urgent cases, tell the user to call 911. 
            Click the "Chat with Carebot" button to find help healthcare services near you!
