        <p>Carebot is a chatbot powered by ChatGPT v3.5 that helps connect Alabama residents to healthcare resources. 
            Using a database of healthcare providers, the services they offer, their locations, and the users' zip code, the chatbot can connect the user to a healthcare service provider near them. 
            Carebot asks the user for any information it needs to help them out, and it focuses conversations on finding medical resources in Alabama. 
            Click the "Chat with Carebot" button to find help healthcare services near you!
