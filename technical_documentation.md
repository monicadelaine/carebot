Additional notes on the file.

# /
**Purpose:** This is the root of the repository.

## /.dockerignore
**Purpose:** This file tells Docker which files to ignore (i.e.: not to copy to the image). These are mostly machine-generated files like the Python cache.

## /.env
**Purpose:** This file contains the environment variables required to setup the Docker image and run Django. This file must be created manually. It is not included in the repository. This file should **never** be uploaded to any kind of repository for security purposes. Use environment variables and secrets according to best security practices.

| Variable Name | Type       | Value        | Other Notes |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| OPEN_API_KEY | string | (varies) | This value is provided when you pay OpenAI for an API key. |
| DEBUG | string | True *or* False | [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/settings/#debug) |
| INSECURE_FLAG | string | --insecure *or* blank | [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#cmdoption-runserver-insecure) |
| SECRET_KEY | string | (varies) | [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/settings/#secret-key) |

## /.gitattributes
**Purpose:** This file is intended to force Git to use the Unix-style LF file ending for shell scripts, such as docker-entrypoint.

## /.gitignore
**Purpose:** See [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

## /database_dump.sql
**Purpose:** This is the database dump of healthcare resources that should be loaded when the Docker container is started.

## /docker-compose.yml
**Purpose:** This is the file used by the `docker compose` command when building or starting the container. This includes both the PostGIS and carebot containers. The file relies on the `INSECURE_FLAG` value in `.env`. See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## /docker-entrypoint.sh
**Purpose:** See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#entrypoint).

## /Dockerfile
**Purpose:** This is the file Docker uses to set up the image upon build. Ours includes Python, PostgreSQL, and Django, among others. See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/).

## /README.md
**Purpose:** This file provides basic setup instructions.

## /requirements.txt
**Purpose:** This file contains the Python dependencies the pipenv will automatically install upon Docker setup. See [pipenv documentation](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/pipfile.html#importing-from-requirements-txt).

## /technical_documentation.md
**Purpose:** This document covers the purpose and function of all of the files in this repository that were not automatically generated.
