# /

**Purpose:** This is the root of the repository.

## /.dockerignore

**Purpose:** This file tells Docker which files to ignore (i.e.: not to copy to the image). These are mostly machine-generated files like the Python cache.

## /.env

**Purpose:** This file contains the environment variables required to setup the Docker image and run Django. This file must be created manually. It is not included in the repository. This file should **never** be uploaded to any kind of repository for security purposes. Use environment variables and secrets according to best security practices.

## /carebot/carebot/urls.py

 This file contains the url patterns for the Django project. Most of the project's urls are accessed through the `chat` app. See [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/http/urls/).

## /carebot/carebot/wsgi.py

 See [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/howto/deployment/wsgi/).

# /carebot/chat/

 This folder contains files for Django app `chat` (not project). It was automatically generated when the Django app was created. The `chat` app is the bulk of the Carebot project.

## /carebot/chat/\_\_init\_\_.py

 This file was automatically generated when the Django project was created. It is empty, but it tells Python that the files in this directory should be treated as a package.

## /carebot/chat/admin.py

 This file was automatically generated when the Django app was created. See [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/contrib/admin/actions/).

## /carebot/chat/apps.py

 This file was automatically generated when the Django app was created. See [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/applications/).

## /carebot/chat/forms.py

 This file contains the form(s) for the project. Currently, the only form is the QueryForm, which dictates the attributes of form used to send a user's chat messages. See See [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/http/urls/) for more on forms.

## /carebot/chat/models.py

 This file contains the models for the project. See [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/http/urls/) for more on models.

| Model Name | Purpose |
| ---------- | ------- |
| MessageType | MessageType is an IntEnum for the type of a message (user, chatbot, or system). User messages are sent by the user, chatbot messages are generated primarily by ChatGPT, and system messages are for communicating errors directly to the user. |
| Message | This model stores messages of all kinds. All bubbles that appear on the chat page are representations of a Message model. |
| ChatRequestGeoData | This model stores a user's location data anonymously. It is currently unused because the location feature cannot be implemented without HTTPS. |

## /carebot/chat/tests.py

**Purpose:** This file contains Django test cases for testing chat view functionalities, AJAX requests, session management, and database interactions within a chat application.See [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/testing/overview/).

## /carebot/chat/urls.py

 This file contains the url patterns for the `chat` Django app. See [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/http/urls/).

## /carebot/chat/views.py

 This file contains the view functions for the Django project. See [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/http/views/).

| Function Name | Parameters | Return Value | Other Notes |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| storeUserLocation()   | HTTP Request | JSON Response  | Loads the JSON data from `sendUserLocation()`, stores the user's latitude and longitude in tuple, appends to array `user_coords`. Often raises Exception due to accessing the HTTP Request multiple times. Catches exception and passes. Needs to be stored within external database for persistance of user location data. Planned to be used within the dashboard heatmap to track where most popular queries are coming from.  |
| chat_view()  |  HTTP Request     |   render() HTML page / JSON Reponse   | **Rate Limiting:** This main Django view takes advantage of the Django `@ratelimting` decorator to limit users to a certain number of queries/minute. Current rate limiting is set at 10 requests/minute and limits by client IP address. For further Django rate limiting documentation, see [Django Ratelimiting](https://django-ratelimit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). This function attempts to validate the QueryForm (user message to the chatbot). On failure, it returns a generic error page. On success, it continues. It will then pass the 6 most recent Message models and the user input to ChatGPT with a system prompt about its task. If ChatGPT determines there is enough data to make an SQL query, it creates a fake query, the parameters of which are extracted and used in the appropriate pre-written (sanitized) PostgreSQL query. The results are sent back to ChatGPT for a summary and the chatbot message is shown to the user. The new page is finally rendered. If ChatGPT did not determine enough context was present for an SQL query, it will either prompt the user for information or remind the user of its task (thus refusing to go off-topic). All chat messages are logged in Message models. The full details of chat_view() can be found in its comments in `views.py`. |
| limited_chat_view()    |  HTTP Request, Exception      | render() HTML page / JSON Reponse  | Django view specific to catching the Django rate limiting exception in order to trigger the traditional `error.html` page rather than the 403 Forbidden page. Checks if passed exception is an instance of Ratelimited Exception from the ratelimit.exceptions class. Configured by Middleware and triggered by `RATELIMIT_VIEW` within `settings.py`.     |
| log_location_for_heatmap() | city, county, resource_type | None | TODO (Kittson) |
| load_json_data() | file_path | Any | TODO (Kittson) |
| geocode_city() | city_name | tuple | TODO (Kittson) |
| geolocation_data() | HTTP request | JSON Reponse | TODO (Kittson) |
| table_data() | HTTP request | JSON Reponse | TODO (Kittson) |
| rate_limited_error_view()    |  HTTP Request      |  render() HTML page / JSON Reponse | Django view specific to catching the Django rate limiting exception. Also has commented out functionality to add any rate limited IP addresses to the list of blacklisted IPs to avoid future malicious users. Renders the standard `error.html` view. |
| error_view() | HTTP request, *args | render() of HTML page | This function renders the generic error page `error.html`. |
| home_view() | HTTP request | render() of HTML page | This function renders `home.html`. |
| dashboard_view() | HTTP request | render() of HTML page | This function renders `dashboard.html`. |
| about_carebot_view() | HTTP request | render() of HTML page | This function renders `about-carebot.html`. |
| about_us_view() | HTTP request | render() of HTML page | This function renders `about-us.html`. |
| deliverables_view() | HTTP request | render() of HTML page | This function renders `deliverables.html`. |
| documentation_view() | HTTP request | render() of HTML page | This function renders `documentation.html`. |
| faq_view() | HTTP request | render() of HTML page | This function renders `faq.html`. |
| handler404() | HTTP request, *args | render() of HTML page | This function renders the generic error page `error.html` with additional 404 information. See [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/views/#error-views) for more on error handlers. |
| handler500() | HTTP request, *args | render() of HTML page | This function renders the generic error page `error.html` with additional 500 information. See [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/views/#error-views) for more on error handlers. |
